# SOL Programming language

It's a (almost) purely functional, dynamically typed programming language that runs on SOL VM.

Being functional, SOL provides

1. Immutable data types
2. Tail calls
3. First class functions
4. Lambda functions (capturing its environment)
5. Garbage collector (Not yet)

It's heavily influenced by Python, Scheme, and got some inspirations from Rust, Haskell and Elixir.
